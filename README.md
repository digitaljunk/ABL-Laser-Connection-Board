# ABL-Laser-Connection-Board
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2757972

This circuit board provides ABL and Laser functionally trough a 6 wire cable to the print head. It's designed for laser modules with separate 5V PWM and 12V work voltage

It also brings down the 12V PWM signal from the part cooling fan to 5V PWM to
connect the laser module PWM/TTL port.
It provides a 12V work voltage with the ability to add a safety switch to prevent laser operation during printer start up. You can also add door switches or an emergency switch so secure the laser operation.
You can optionally connect an external power supply for the laser and ABL sensor.
The board provides an optocoupler for the ABL sensor.
All connections are provided via an 6-pin connector to the print head.

You can mount the PCB to the printer frame with 3mm bolds and headnuts near the Z stepper.

Feel free to provide a nice and snugly printable case. You can bend the LED to point upwards the PCB.
